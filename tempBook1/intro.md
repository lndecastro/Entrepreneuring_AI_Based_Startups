## Entrepreneurial Behavior Characteristics in the AI Era

# Ten Entrepreneurial Competencies: Traditional vs AI-Enhanced

The traditional **Ten Entrepreneurial Competencies** describe the mindset and behaviors that have guided entrepreneurs for decades. However, with the rise of AI, these competencies are being reshaped. Entrepreneurs today not only rely on the competencies, but also on their ability to leverage AI tools for opportunity detection, decision-making, efficiency, and collaboration. The table below presents a side-by-side view of the **traditional competencies** and their **AI-enhanced counterparts**, highlighting how entrepreneurial skills evolve in an AI-driven economy.

| #  | Traditional Competency | AI-Enhanced Competency |
|----|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1  | **Opportunity Seeking and Initiative**<br>Entrepreneurs actively look for opportunities and take initiative to turn them into viable businesses. | **AI-Augmented Opportunity Seeking and Initiative**<br>Entrepreneurs leverage AI for market scanning, trend analysis, and opportunity detection (e.g., NLP on social media, predictive analytics). They use AI copilots to generate and validate new ideas rapidly. |
| 2  | **Persistence**<br>Successful entrepreneurs don't give up easily. They persist in overcoming obstacles and are determined to achieve their goals despite challenges. | **AI-Driven Persistence**<br>Entrepreneurs use AI simulations, reinforcement learning, and iterative prototyping to persist through failuresâ€”treating setbacks as data points to improve algorithms, products, and strategies. |
| 3  | **Commitment**<br>They demonstrate a high level of commitment to their business, going above and beyond to ensure its success. | **Commitment with Human-AI Synergy**<br>Entrepreneurs show commitment not only through personal effort but also by designing AI-human workflows that maximize productivity and long-term trust. |
| 4  | **Demand for Efficiency and Quality**<br>Entrepreneurs strive to improve processes, products, and services. | **Demand for AI-Optimized Efficiency and Quality**<br>Entrepreneurs apply AI tools (automation, generative design, predictive monitoring) to optimize operations and maintain high-quality standards. |
| 5  | **Risk-Taking**<br>They are willing to take calculated risks and make decisions under uncertainty. | **AI-Assisted Risk-Taking**<br>Entrepreneurs combine human judgment with AI-powered risk assessment models (scenario analysis, simulations, fraud detection) to make smarter decisions under uncertainty. |
| 6  | **Goal Setting**<br>Entrepreneurs set clear, challenging, and achievable goals. | **Goal Setting with AI Metrics**<br>Entrepreneurs use AI dashboards and predictive KPIs to set SMART goals and adjust them dynamically based on real-time data. |
| 7  | **Information Seeking**<br>They constantly seek out relevant information through research, feedback, and trends. | **AI-Enhanced Information Seeking**<br>Entrepreneurs integrate AI research assistants, scrapers, and domain-specific LLMs to gather and synthesize information at scale. |
| 8  | **Systematic Planning and Monitoring**<br>Entrepreneurs develop detailed plans and regularly monitor progress. | **Systematic Planning and Monitoring with AI Agents**<br>Entrepreneurs deploy AI agents for agile management, scenario simulation, and adaptive monitoring. |
| 9  | **Persuasion and Networking**<br>They persuade others and build strong networks for growth. | **AI-Powered Persuasion and Networking**<br>Entrepreneurs use AI to personalize pitches, analyze investor profiles, optimize engagement, and find high-value connections. |
| 10 | **Independence and Self-Confidence**<br>Entrepreneurs are confident, autonomous, and take responsibility for decisions. | **Augmented Independence and Self-Confidence**<br>Entrepreneurs maintain autonomy while leveraging AI copilots for decision support, gaining confidence from mastering human-AI collaboration. |

## 1. Key Roles in a Startup Team  

When forming your startup team, it is important to have **complementary skills**. Here are some of the most common roles in startups:  

### CEO â€“ Chief Executive Officer  
- The **leader of the company** and the one who keeps the team aligned.  
- Focuses on **vision, strategy, and decision-making**.  
- Often the main spokesperson who pitches the startup to investors and partners.  

### CFO â€“ Chief Financial Officer  
- Takes care of the **money side of the business**.  
- Manages the **budget, funding, costs, and financial planning**.  
- Helps ensure the startup can grow in a sustainable way.  

### CTO â€“ Chief Technology Officer  
- Responsible for the **technology and product development**.  
- Oversees the **software, data, AI models, or any tech tools** used.  
- Ensures the startupâ€™s solution is **feasible, scalable, and secure**.  

### CMO â€“ Chief Marketing Officer  
- Focuses on **promoting the product and reaching customers**.  
- Handles **branding, communication, social media, and advertising**.  
- Ensures the startup finds and keeps its target audience.  

### COO â€“ Chief Operating Officer  
- Manages the **day-to-day operations** of the startup.  
- Ensures everything runs smoothly: people, processes, and projects.  
- Often works closely with the CEO to turn strategy into action.  

### Other Important Roles  
- **Product Manager (PM):** Makes sure the product solves the customerâ€™s problem and is easy to use.  
- **Sales Lead:** Builds relationships with customers and closes deals.  
- **Customer Success Lead:** Ensures users are happy and stay engaged with the product.  

## Why Complementary Skills Matter  

- A startup usually starts **small (2â€“3 founders)**, so it is not possible to have all roles from day one.  
- What matters is **balance**:  
  - Someone who **leads and sets vision** (CEO type).  
  - Someone who **builds the technology or product** (CTO type).  
  - Someone who **connects with customers and markets the solution** (CMO/Sales type).  
- As the startup grows, other roles (CFO, COO, etc.) can be added.  

ðŸ‘‰ **Tip:** When forming your team, choose partners who bring **different strengths** so you donâ€™t all overlap. Think: *Who is the visionary? Who is the builder? Who is the seller?*

## 2. Startup Meetup  

### Objective  
To promote interaction among students, foster networking, and facilitate the creation of startup teams.  

### Setup  
- Total students: ~35 (5 groups of 7 students each)  
- Group size: up to 5 students per startup team (later narrowed to partnerships of up to 3 per startup)  
- Activity length: 60 minutes  
- Materials:  
  - Personal business cards (one per student)  
  - Timer/clock  
  - Whiteboard or projector to track time and instructions  

### Instructions  

1. **Form Groups (5 minutes)**  
   - Divide the class into **5 groups of 7 students each**.  
   - Each group will conduct the activity in parallel.  

2. **Student Introductions (7 minutes per group)**  
   - Each student has **1 minute** to introduce themselves to their group.  
   - Introductions should include:  
     - Name and background  
     - Interests in AI and entrepreneurship  
     - Skills they bring to a potential team  
     - The type of startup or challenge they would like to work on  

3. **Business Card Exchange**  
   - After introductions, students exchange **personal business cards** with peers they would like to collaborate with.  
   - Students can give their card to multiple classmates, but must do so thoughtfully (not to everyone).  

4. **Rotation / Networking**  
   - After each round, students may **rotate to another group** to expand connections, depending on time available.  
   - Repeat introductions.  

5. **Team Formation (10 minutes)**  
   - Based on card exchanges and mutual interest, students start forming **partnerships of up to 3 students per startup team**.  
   - Encourage students to select partners who complement their skills.  

### Timing Overview  

- **5 minutes**: Group setup & instructions  
- **7 minutes per group x 5 groups (in parallel)**: Student introductions (35 minutes total across all groups, but only 7 minutes elapsed per group since running simultaneously)  
- **5 minutes**: Business card exchange  
- **10 minutes**: Team formation and confirmation  

### Expected Outcome  
- Students build initial connections and identify peers they want to work with.  
- **Up to 7 startup teams** are formed, each with up to 3 students.  
- The activity mirrors a real-world networking event, preparing students for collaboration in entrepreneurial environments.

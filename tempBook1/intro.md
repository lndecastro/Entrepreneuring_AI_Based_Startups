## 1. Key Roles in a Startup Team  

When forming your startup team, it is important to have **complementary skills**. Here are some of the most common roles in startups:  

### CEO â€“ Chief Executive Officer  
- The **leader of the company** and the one who keeps the team aligned.  
- Focuses on **vision, strategy, and decision-making**.  
- Often the main spokesperson who pitches the startup to investors and partners.  

### CFO â€“ Chief Financial Officer  
- Takes care of the **money side of the business**.  
- Manages the **budget, funding, costs, and financial planning**.  
- Helps ensure the startup can grow in a sustainable way.  

### CTO â€“ Chief Technology Officer  
- Responsible for the **technology and product development**.  
- Oversees the **software, data, AI models, or any tech tools** used.  
- Ensures the startupâ€™s solution is **feasible, scalable, and secure**.  

### CMO â€“ Chief Marketing Officer  
- Focuses on **promoting the product and reaching customers**.  
- Handles **branding, communication, social media, and advertising**.  
- Ensures the startup finds and keeps its target audience.  

### COO â€“ Chief Operating Officer

### Other Important Roles  
- **Product Manager (PM):** Makes sure the product solves the customerâ€™s problem and is easy to use.

## Why Complementary Skills Matter  

- A startup usually starts **small (2â€“3 founders)**, so it is not possible to have all roles from day one.  
- What matters is **balance**:  
  - Someone who **leads and sets vision** (CEO type).  
  - Someone who **builds the technology or product** (CTO type).  
  - Someone who **connects with customers and markets the solution** (CMO/Sales type).  
- As the startup grows, other roles (CFO, COO, etc.) can be added.  

ðŸ‘‰ **Tip:** When forming your team, choose partners who bring **different strengths** so you donâ€™t all overlap. Think: *Who is the visionary? Who is the builder? Who is the seller?*  


## 2. Startup Meetup  

### Objective  
To promote interaction among students, foster networking, and facilitate the creation of startup teams.  

### Setup  
- Total students: ~35 (5 groups of 7 students each)

- Materials:  
  - Personal business cards (one per student)  
  - Timer/clock  
  - Whiteboard or projector to track time and instructions  

### Instructions

   - Each group will conduct the activity in parallel.  

2. **Student Introductions (7 minutes per group)**  
   - Each student has **1 minute** to introduce themselves to their group.

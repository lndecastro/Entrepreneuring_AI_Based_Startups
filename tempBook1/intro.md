## 1.8 Startup Meetup  

### Objective  
To promote interaction among students, foster networking, and facilitate the creation of startup teams.  

### Setup  
- Total students: ~35 (5 groups of 7 students each)  
- Group size: up to 5 students per startup team (later narrowed to partnerships of up to 3 per startup)  
- Activity length: 60 minutes  
- Materials:  
  - Personal business cards (one per student)  
  - Timer/clock  
  - Whiteboard or projector to track time and instructions  

### Instructions  

1. **Form Groups (5 minutes)**  
   - Divide the class into **5 groups of 7 students each**.  
   - Each group will conduct the activity in parallel.  

2. **Student Introductions (7 minutes per group)**  
   - Each student has **1 minute** to introduce themselves to their group.  
   - Introductions should include:  
     - Name and background  
     - Interests in AI and entrepreneurship  
     - Skills they bring to a potential team  
     - The type of startup or challenge they would like to work on  

3. **Business Card Exchange**  
   - After introductions, students exchange **personal business cards** with peers they would like to collaborate with.  
   - Students can give their card to multiple classmates, but must do so thoughtfully (not to everyone).  

4. **Rotation / Networking**  
   - After each round, students may **rotate to another group** to expand connections, depending on time available.  
   - Repeat introductions.  

5. **Team Formation (10 minutes)**  
   - Based on card exchanges and mutual interest, students start forming **partnerships of up to 3 students per startup team**.  
   - Encourage students to select partners who complement their skills.  

### Timing Overview  

- **5 minutes**: Group setup & instructions  
- **7 minutes per group x 5 groups (in parallel)**: Student introductions (35 minutes total across all groups, but only 7 minutes elapsed per group since running simultaneously)  
- **5 minutes**: Business card exchange  
- **10 minutes**: Team formation and confirmation  

### Expected Outcome  
- Students build initial connections and identify peers they want to work with.  
- **Up to 7 startup teams** are formed, each with up to 3 students.  
- The activity mirrors a real-world networking event, preparing students for collaboration in entrepreneurial environments.

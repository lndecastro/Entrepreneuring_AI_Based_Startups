# Topic 6: Lean Startup
The **Lean Startup** is a scientific approach to building new products and services under conditions of **extreme uncertainty**. Grounded in **Lean Thinking** (eliminating waste and maximizing value), it replaces lengthy planning with rapid **Build–Measure–Learn** cycles that validate hypotheses with real customers. The goal is to **discover what to build**, something customers want and will pay for, in the **shortest possible time and using the smallest amount of resources**.

## 6.1 Lean Thinking & Startups
**Lean Thinking** aims to do **more with less** (less time, space, budget, and effort) while delivering **exactly** what customers want. Five guiding principles: 
1) Define Value → from the **customer’s perspective**  
2) Map the Value Stream  
3) Create Flow  
4) Establish Pull  
5) Pursue Perfection  

In startups, this translates into learning fast which activities create value and eliminating everything else (*muda*, waste).

**What is a Startup?**  
> “A human institution designed to create a new product or service under **extreme uncertainty**.”  
**Primary goal:** discover, as fast as possible, **what to build** that customers want and will buy.

**Core principles for startups:**  
1) Entrepreneurs are everywhere
2) Entrepreneurship is management
3) Validated learning
4) Build–Measure–Learn
5) Innovation accounting

## 6.2 The Build–Measure–Learn (B–M–L) Loop
The Lean method is an iterative loop:

**Build** → turn hypotheses into an **MVP**  
**Measure** → collect **actionable, accessible, auditable** metrics (avoid vanity metrics)  
**Learn** → decide to **persevere** or **pivot** based on evidence  

![Build–Measure–Learn Loop](./Data/BMLLoop.png)  
*Use B–M–L to validate both the **Value hypothesis** (“do users get value?”) and the **Growth hypothesis** (“how do new users find it?”).*

### 6.2.1 Build: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
An **MVP** is the smallest product experiment that enables a **full B–M–L cycle** with **minimal cost and time**. Forms include **demo videos**, **concierge/Wizard-of-Oz** services, clickable prototypes, spreadsheets, landing pages, etc. Classic examples (e.g., early Dropbox video) show how to validate demand **before** investing in full builds.

![Minimal Viable Product](./Data/MVP.png)  

#### Real-World MVP Examples

Below are concise examples of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) that validated core hypotheses with minimal time and cost. Each entry highlights the **MVP type**, **what was tested**, and the **signal** that justified further investment.

**1) Dropbox — Explainer Video MVP**
**Type:** Video demo (no full product)  
**Tested:** Do people want seamless file sync across devices?  
**Signal:** Waitlist spikes and qualitative feedback from a short screencast validated demand before building complex sync tech.

**2) Airbnb — Concierge MVP**
**Type:** Manual service behind a simple website  
**Tested:** Will travelers pay to stay in someone’s home, and will hosts list?  
**Signal:** Founders personally photographed listings and messaged early guests/hosts; paid bookings validated the marketplace concept.

**3) Zappos — Wizard-of-Oz MVP**
**Type:** Fake-automation; manual order fulfillment  
**Tested:** Will customers buy shoes online without trying them?  
**Signal:** Founder posted local store photos online; when an order arrived, he bought at retail and shipped—real purchases proved demand.

**4) Buffer — Landing Page + Pricing Smoke Test**
**Type:** Landing pages with “plans” and an email capture  
**Tested:** Will users pay for scheduled social posts, and at what price points?  
**Signal:** Click-throughs on pricing tiers and email signups quantified willingness to pay before building.

**5) Uber (UberCab) — Single-Neighborhood Pilot**
**Type:** Tiny, geo-fenced launch with a handful of cars  
**Tested:** Will people tap a phone to hail a black car and accept dynamic ETAs?  
**Signal:** Repeat rides and word-of-mouth within San Francisco validated the core experience.

**6) Groupon — Blog + PDF Coupons**
**Type:** WordPress site; manually generated coupons (PDFs)  
**Tested:** Will collective discounts drive enough buyer interest to close deals?  
**Signal:** Daily redemptions and merchant signups demonstrated traction without a full platform.

**7) DoorDash (PaloAltoDelivery) — Scrappy Local Delivery**
**Type:** Simple site listing menus; founders doing deliveries  
**Tested:** Do local restaurants and customers want third-party delivery?  
**Signal:** Orders via a basic form and phone calls showed real demand; operational pain points informed the product.

**8) Pebble — Crowdfunding Pre-Orders**
**Type:** Kickstarter campaign with prototype visuals/specs  
**Tested:** Will customers pre-pay for a customizable smartwatch?  
**Signal:** Massive pre-orders derisked manufacturing and validated early adopter demand.

**9) Morning Brew — Email Newsletter MVP**
**Type:** Daily email curated by founders (no app)  
**Tested:** Will busy readers subscribe and engage with concise business news?  
**Signal:** Rapid list growth and open rates validated product–market fit for content and tone.

**10) Spotify (early US launch) — Limited-Access Beta**
**Type:** Invite-only desktop app with core streaming working  
**Tested:** Does near-instant playback change music habits and retention?  
**Signal:** High session time, playlist creation, and referrals inside a small cohort justified licensing and scale-up.

**11) Figma — Private Beta with Browser Tech**
**Type:** Restricted-access design editor in the browser  
**Tested:** Can a web-first collaborative editor meet performance/UX needs of designers?  
**Signal:** Power-user feedback on multi-cursor editing and low-latency interactions validated the technical bet.

**12) Amazon Prime — Offer & Cohort MVP**
**Type:** Soft launch of membership benefits to a subset of users  
**Tested:** Will flat-fee fast shipping drive higher frequency and basket size?  
**Signal:** Cohort lifts in repeat purchase and annual value validated the subscription economics.

#### How to Choose Your MVP Type
- **Explainer/landing page** when the core risk is **demand**.  
- **Concierge/Wizard-of-Oz** when the core risk is **experience** or **workflow fit**.  
- **Geo-fenced/pilot** when the core risk is **operations** or **supply**.  
- **Pre-orders/crowdfunding** when the core risk is **willingness to pay** and **unit economics**.  
- **Private beta** when the core risk is **technical feasibility** and **usability**.

> Aim for the smallest experiment that lets you run a full **Build–Measure–Learn** cycle in days or weeks—not months.

### 6.2.2 Measure: Innovation Accounting & Metrics (AARRR)
To know if you are making real progress, use **innovation accounting**:

- **AARRR funnel:** **Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Referral → Revenue**  
- Metric properties: **Actionable** (clear cause–effect), **Accessible** (simple, concrete), **Auditable** (verifiable)  
- Prefer **cohort analysis** (behavior over time by signup batch) to vanity metrics

![AARRR Funnel](./Data/AARRR.png)

**Cohort sketch**

| Cohort (Week) | Users | D+1 | D+7 | D+14 | D+28 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| W1 | 120 | 42% | 25% | 17% | 10% |
| W2 | … | … | … | … | … |

#### Innovation Accounting — Real-World Examples

Below are concrete examples of **actionable, accessible, auditable** metrics and decision rules that teams used to drive learning and growth.

**1) Slack — “2,000 Messages” Activation Threshold**
- **Metric:** Cumulative messages exchanged by a team.  
- **Why it works:** Slack found that teams crossing **~2,000 messages** had meaningfully “tried” the product and were likely to stick — a clear **activation** milestone to guide experiments, onboarding, and sales assists.

**2) Airbnb — “Nights Booked” as the North Star**
- **Metric:** Number of **nights booked**.  
- **Why it works:** Directly reflects value created for both sides of the marketplace and ties closely to revenue; used as a top-level **North Star** to align product and growth work.

**3) Dropbox — Referral Loop & K-Factor**
- **Metric:** Referral-driven signups per user, tracked to a viral growth rate (**k-factor**) and cohort lifts.  
- **Why it works:** The team instrumented referrals (extra storage) and measured invite conversion — the program is credited with **~3,900% user growth in 15 months**. 

**4) Duolingo — DAU/MAU & State-Transition Growth Model**
- **Metric:** **DAU/MAU** engagement plus a **growth model** that tracks daily transitions between user activity states to pinpoint where to intervene.  
- **Why it works:** Breaks a headline metric into auditable sub-rates (e.g., reactivation, resurrection) and lets teams attribute changes to specific product experiments. Duolingo also reports DAU/MAU in investor updates. 

**5) Facebook — DAU/MAU “Stickiness”**
- **Metric:** **DAU/MAU** ratio as a simple, comparable engagement indicator.  
- **Why it works:** Actionable for product teams (improve daily habits) and auditable in analytics; widely adopted as a benchmark for social/consumer apps. 

**6) Superhuman — 40% “Very Disappointed” PMF Survey**
- **Metric:** % of surveyed users who would be **“very disappointed”** if they could no longer use the product (Sean Ellis test).  
- **Decision rule:** **≥40%** indicates initial product/market fit; <40% → iterate on who loves you and why before scaling. Superhuman operationalized this into an ongoing engine. 

**7) Netflix — Retention by Cohort**
- **Metric:** **Temporal cohort retention** (triangle tables), tracked by signup month and content exposure.  
- **Why it works:** Separates acquisition spikes from true retention; helps attribute retention changes to content drops or UX changes. (Netflix has publicly discussed cohort analysis approaches.) 

**8) Zoom/Calendar-Style Collaboration — Viral Invitations → Activation**
- **Metric:** **Invite → install → first-use** funnel from meeting links (viral coefficient, time-to-invite, invitee activation).  
- **Why it works:** Measures product-inherent virality (every host brings guests) and ties it to auditable conversion events — a classic **growth hypothesis** loop used by collaborative tools. (Industry analyses commonly cite these as core viral metrics.) 

#### How to Apply These in Your Startup
1. **Pick one “North Star”** that best captures delivered value (e.g., nights booked, tasks completed).  
2. Define **one primary metric per AARRR stage** and make each **actionable, accessible, auditable**.  
3. Add a clear **decision rule** (e.g., “pivot review if D30 retention <10% for two cohorts”).  
4. **Cohort everything** — measure changes over time by acquisition week/month to see real learning (not vanity spikes). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}


### 6.2.3 Learn: Persevere or Pivot
**Validated learning** is the empirical proof you have learned something true about customers. When learning plateaus or usage declines, consider a **pivot** (a **structured course correction**) to test a new hypothesis (product, strategy, or growth engine). Reassess on a cadence (e.g., every **2–4 months**).

**Pivot catalog:** 
- Zoom-in/Zoom-out
- Customer Segment
- Customer Need
- Platform
- Business Model
- Growth
- Channel
- Technology

![Pivot Types](./Data/PivotCatalog.png)

#### Pivot Catalog — Real-World Examples

Below are eight classic pivot types from Lean Startup, each paired with a concrete company example.

**1) Zoom-In Pivot**
**Definition:** A single feature becomes the whole product.  
**Example:** **Instagram** — Focused Burbn down to photo capture + filters + social sharing.  
**What changed:** Narrowed the scope to the one feature users loved; killed the rest.

**2) Zoom-Out Pivot**
**Definition:** The original product becomes one feature of a larger suite.  
**Example:** **HubSpot** — Expanded from a marketing tool into a full CRM and RevOps platform.  
**What changed:** Broadened scope to include sales, service, and ops around the core marketing feature.

**3) Customer Segment Pivot**
**Definition:** Same product core, different primary users.  
**Example:** **Slack** — Repurposed an internal team chat tool (from a failed game project) for organizations.  
**What changed:** Target customer moved from a game studio’s internal use to teams and enterprises.

**4) Customer Need Pivot**
**Definition:** Address a different problem for (often) similar users.  
**Example:** **YouTube** — Shifted from video dating (“Tune In, Hook Up”) to open video sharing for everyone.  
**What changed:** The core job-to-be-done changed from dating to broad media hosting/sharing.

**5) Platform Pivot**
**Definition:** Move from an application to a platform (or vice-versa).  
**Example:** **Shopify** — From a snowboard e-shop (Snowdevil) to a platform enabling any merchant to sell online.  
**What changed:** Built tools + APIs for others, not just a single storefront.

**6) Business Model Pivot**
**Definition:** Change how value is captured (pricing, packaging, revenue model).  
**Example:** **Adobe** — From perpetual licenses (Creative Suite) to subscriptions (Creative Cloud).  
**What changed:** Revenue shifted to recurring; lowered upfront price, increased LTV and update cadence.

**7) Channel Pivot**
**Definition:** Switch the main distribution/sales channel.  
**Example:** **Nike** — Tilted from wholesale-heavy to direct-to-consumer (DTC), then evolved to a blended channel strategy with select retail partners.  
**What changed:** Go-to-market emphasis and partner mix; invested in owned stores/apps.

**8) Technology Pivot**
**Definition:** Solve the same problem with a different technology engine.  
**Example:** **PayPal** — From PalmPilot “beaming” payments to email/web-based payments.  
**What changed:** Core delivery tech moved to the web, unlocking scale and adoption.

## 6.3 Engines of Growth
Choose and instrument **one primary engine** at a time:

- **Sticky:** focus on retention/return use (minimize churn).  
- **Viral:** product use drives invites/shares (viral coefficient > 1).  
- **Paid:** CAC < LTV via sales/ads; scale with positive unit economics.

![Engines of Growth](./Data/GrowthEngines.png)

### Engines of Growth — Examples (Sticky, Viral, Paid)

**1) Sticky Growth (Retention-Led)** <p>
**Idea:** Grow by keeping users coming back; new users accumulate faster than churn.  <p>
**Key metrics:** Retention (D1/D7/D30), churn, (Weekly Active Users/Monthly Active Users) WAU/MAU ratio, cohort curves.

- **Spotify / Apple Music** — Playlists, recommendations, and daily mixes create habits; family plans reduce churn.
- **Slack** — Daily team workflows (messages, integrations) make it “sticky”; expansion seats compound within accounts.
- **Notion** — Docs, wikis, and databases become embedded in team processes; switching costs rise over time.

**When to prioritize:** You solve recurring problems and can build habits or switching costs.

**2) Viral Growth (Network-Led)** <p>
**Idea:** Existing users recruit new users through product-inherent sharing or collaboration. <p>
**Key metrics:** Viral coefficient (k), invite-to-install rate, time-to-invite, activation of invited users.

- **Zoom** — Every meeting link is an invitation to a prospective user; guests experience the product instantly.
- **Dropbox** — Extra storage for inviting friends; shared folders expose non-users to the product.
- **WhatsApp / Telegram** — Utility rises with each contact that joins; address-book invites and group chats drive spread.

**When to prioritize:** Collaboration or content-sharing is core; marginal cost to add a user is near zero.

**3) Paid Growth (Unit-Economics-Led)** <p>
**Idea:** Spend on acquisition profitably (ads, affiliates, outbound); grow as long as **LTV > CAC**. <p>
**Key metrics:** CAC, LTV, payback period, ROAS (Revenue Over Advertisement Spent), contribution margin, blended vs. incremental CAC.

- **HelloFresh** — Performance marketing + promos; track cohort payback through repeat meal kits.
- **Amazon Prime acquisition** — Paid placements, cross-sell, and device bundling to drive Prime signups (recurring LTV).
- **B2B SaaS (e.g., HubSpot)** — Content + paid search + SDRs; CAC payback driven by subscription retention and expansion.

**When to prioritize:** You have clear pricing, solid retention, and can measure/pay back acquisition spend.

#### Quick Selector
- Strong **habit** or high switching costs → choose **Sticky** first.  
- Built-in **network effects** or sharing loops → prioritize **Viral**.  
- Clear **unit economics** and scalable channels → lean into **Paid**.

> Tip: Focus on **one primary engine** at a time; instrument it deeply. Add secondary engines only after the first is working and measurable.

## 6.5 Worked Examples (Topic 5 Cases)

Below are end-to-end Lean Startup examples for the two Topic 5 cases:
1) **AI Personal Health Companion**  
2) **AI-Powered Language Tutor for Immigrants**

Each case includes: Lean Principles Cycle → B-M-L Loop → AARRR & Cohorts → Possible Pivots → Engines of Growth → Kanban.

### Case A — AI Personal Health Companion

#### A.1 Lean Principles Cycle (Value → Flow → Pull → Perfection)

**Define Value (Customer’s view)**  
- Value = *plain-language, timely insights* that reduce anxiety and help follow care plans.  
- Top “jobs”: track vitals; understand anomalies; follow doctor plan.

**Map Value Stream**  
- Data intake (wearables/EHR) → Insight generation (rules/LLM) → Delivery (mobile cards/SMS) → User action (acknowledge/save) → Outcome (adherence, reduced anxiety).

**Create Flow**  
- Batch nightly → switch to event-triggered “insight cards” to shorten time-to-value (< 5 min from reading to nudge).

**Establish Pull**  
- Users subscribe to specific concerns (e.g., glucose spikes).  
- Only push insights when thresholds/metaconditions met (avoid notification fatigue).

**Pursue Perfection**  
- Weekly defect review: % irrelevant insights, % late notifications.  
- Kaizen: prune rules, refine language, personalize timing windows.

#### A.2 Build–Measure–Learn (B-M-L) Loop

**Leap-of-Faith (Value)**  
- *Hypothesis:* “Plain-language insight cards increase activation to ≥ **30%** in 7 days.”

**Build (MVP)**  
- Wizard-of-Oz: clinician/analyst curates daily SMS/email “insight cards” for a 50-user waitlist.

**Measure (Actionable metric)**  
- **Activation:** open ≥3 insights + save ≥1 card within 7 days.

**Learn (Decision rule)**  
- If Activation ≥ 30% → persevere: build lightweight in-app insights.  
- If < 20% → test **Customer Need** pivot (timing vs. content; anxiety vs. adherence focus).

#### A.3 AARRR Metrics & Cohort Table

**AARRR Plan**

| Stage | Metric (Definition) | Target | Instrumentation |
|---|---|---:|---|

| W2 | 65 | 31% | 24% | 11% |
| W3 | 80 | 29% | 22% | 10% |

#### A.4 Possible Pivots (Triggers & Actions)

| Pivot Type | Trigger (Signal) | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Customer Need | Activation ≥ 30% but D+28 < 10% | Shift focus: medication reminders → clinician Q&A “micro-explanations” |
| Zoom-In | 70% of usage on “trend explanation” feature | Make “trend cards” the core product; remove low-use modules |
| Channel | CAC volatile; payback > 6 months | Test provider referral channel (clinics bundle app) |
| Business Model | High use, low conversion | Introduce family plan + clinician dashboard upsell |

#### A.5 Engines of Growth (Choice & Next Experiment)

- **Sticky (recommended first):** build retention via timely, high-relevance insights.  
  - *Next test:* notification timing personalization A/B; target +3–5pp D+7.
- **Viral:** caregiver sharing; “Share insight with family/doctor.”  
  - *Next test:* 1-click share; measure K-factor change (baseline ~0.1 → goal 0.2–0.25).
- **Paid:** employer/insurer B2B2C; CAC via brokers.

# Topic 6 — Lean Startup Methodology

## 1) Learning Objectives
By the end of this topic, students will be able to:
- Explain Lean Thinking and how it combats **muda** (waste) in startups.  
- Describe the Lean Startup loop (**Build–Measure–Learn**) and identify **Leap-of-Faith (LoF)** assumptions, **Value** and **Growth** hypotheses. 
- Design a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** experiment for an AI-based startup. 
- Apply **innovation accounting** (AARRR) with actionable, accessible, auditable metrics and read a simple **cohort** chart.  
- Decide when to **persevere or pivot**, and choose among common **pivot types**.
- Compare the three **growth engines** (sticky, viral, paid) and select one to prioritize.

## 6.1 Lean Thinking (5 principles)
1) Define Value → from the **customer’s perspective**  
2) Map the Value Stream  
3) Create Flow  
4) Establish Pull  
5) Pursue Perfection  
*Goal:* do **more with less** while delivering exactly what customers want.

## 6.2 What is a Startup?
> “A human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of **extreme uncertainty**.”  
*Goal:* discover **what to build** that customers will **want and buy** in the **shortest time**.

## 6.3 Lean Startup in One Loop
**Build → Measure → Learn** (B-M-L): iterate rapidly with real customers to validate hypotheses.

---

## 6.4 MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- A product **version** that enables a **full B-M-L cycle** with **minimal** effort/cost.  
- Examples: *demo video* (Dropbox), **concierge** or **Wizard-of-Oz** service.

## 6.5 Innovation Accounting
- **AARRR funnel:** Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Referral → Revenue.  
- Metrics must be **Actionable**, **Accessible**, **Auditable**.  
- Prefer **cohort** analysis over vanity metrics.

## 6.6 Pivot or Persevere
- Pivot = **structured course correction** to test a new hypothesis (product, strategy, growth).  
- Catalogue: **zoom-in/zoom-out, customer segment, customer need, platform, business model, growth, channel, tech**.  
- Reassess every **2–4 months** or when usage declines.

## 6.7 Growth Engines
- **Sticky:** maximize retention/return use.  
- **Viral:** product use drives organic invites/shares.  
- **Paid:** acquire via sales/ads; must be ROI-positive.

## 6.8 In-Class Agenda (150’)

**(A) Kickoff Poll (5’)**  
Where is your team in B-M-L? *Idea / MVP / In market*.

**(B) Mini-lecture & examples (20’)**  
Connect Lean principles → MVP → AARRR → pivot types with quick cases (Dropbox demo video; Instagram pivot). 

**(C) Studio 1 — LoF & MVP (35’)**  
Teams identify:  
- **LoF assumptions** (Value & Growth).  
- **One MVP experiment** to test Value hypothesis this week.  
- **Success metric & threshold** (e.g., activation ≥ 25% within 7 days). 

**(D) Studio 2 — Metrics & Cohorts (35’)**  
- Design an **AARRR** metric plan (one primary metric per stage).  
- Sketch a **cohort table** (week-by-week retention). 

**(E) Studio 3 — Pivot Readiness (25’)**  
- Choose **one** candidate pivot type and define the trigger (e.g., retention < 10% after 4 weeks). 

**(F) Share-outs & feedback (20’)**

## 6) Worksheets & Templates

### 6.1 MVP Experiment Card
- **Hypothesis (Value/Growth):**  
- **MVP type:** landing page / clickable prototype / concierge / demo video / data-backed mock / email test  
- **Who (segment):**  
- **What happens:**  
- **Primary metric & threshold:**  
- **Time window:**  
- **Decision rule:** persevere / pivot candidate / run follow-up

### 6.2 AARRR Plan (one line each)
- **Acquisition:** channel + qualifying event  
- **Activation:** “good first experience” definition  
- **Retention:** return/use criterion & window  
- **Referral:** built-in invite or incentive  
- **Revenue:** pricing unit & leading indicator

### 6.3 Cohort Table (sketch)
| Cohort (Week) | Users | D+1 | D+7 | D+14 | D+28 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| W1 | 120 | 42% | 25% | 17% | 10% |
| W2 | … | … | … | … | … |

### 6.4 Growth Engine Selector
- If **retention can be high → Sticky**  
- If **network effects/invites → Viral**  
- If **unit economics allow CAC < LTV → Paid**

## 7) AI-Assisted Practice Prompts (copy-paste)

**Prompt 1 — LoF & MVP design**  
```
You are my Lean Startup coach. Given the startup context below, list our top 3 Leap-of-Faith assumptions (clearly label **Value** vs **Growth**), propose 2–3 scrappy MVP experiments to test the **Value** assumption in ≤7 days, and define one primary **actionable** metric and a success threshold for each. Then outline risks, biases, and how to minimize them. *Context:* [paste your idea, customer, problem].
```

**Prompt 2 — Metrics & AARRR**  
```
Design an AARRR plan for our MVP: specify one **actionable, accessible, auditable** metric per stage, with operational definitions, a logging plan, and a 2-week cohort table template I can fill out.
```

**Prompt 3 — Pivot decision aid**  
```
Using our latest cohort metrics (below), assess whether to **persevere or pivot**. If pivoting, recommend the best **pivot type** and justify with evidence. Provide a 2-week action plan. *Data:* [paste activation/retention/referral/revenue].
```

**Prompt 4 — Growth engine choice**  
```
Evaluate **sticky vs viral vs paid** growth for our product. Compute simple unit economics (assume values if missing), identify the **limiting constraint**, and propose the next experiment to validate our chosen engine.
```

**Prompt 5 — Kanban for validated learning**  
```
Create a 2-week Lean **Kanban** with 8–12 items across *Backlog / In Progress / Done / Validated*, prioritizing experiments that maximize **learning per unit time**. Include a WIP limit and a daily stand-up script. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
```

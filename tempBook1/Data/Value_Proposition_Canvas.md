# Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)

The **Value Proposition Canvas** is a strategic tool developed by *Strategyzer* (Osterwalder et al.) to help startups and businesses design products and services that truly meet customer needs.  
It ensures **fit** between what you offer and what your customers actually want.

## Two Main Parts

### 1. Customer Profile (right side)
Describes the customer’s world:
- **Jobs**: What customers are trying to get done (functional, emotional, social).  
- **Pains**: Problems, obstacles, or negative experiences they face while trying to do these jobs.  
- **Gains**: Desired outcomes, benefits, or positive results customers want.  

### 2. Value Map (left side)
Describes how your startup creates value:
- **Products & Services**: What you are offering to customers.  
- **Pain Relievers**: How your product reduces or eliminates key pains.  
- **Gain Creators**: How your product delivers benefits and exceeds expectations.

## The Goal: Achieve Fit
The aim of the VPC is to achieve **fit** between the **Value Map** and the **Customer Profile**:
- Your **pain relievers** must address the customer’s real **pains**.  
- Your **gain creators** must align with the customer’s desired **gains**.  
- Your **products/services** must help customers complete their **jobs** better than alternatives.

## When to Use
The VPC is especially powerful during the **Customer Validation stage** of the Customer Development process, where startups test whether their assumptions about value actually resonate with customers.
